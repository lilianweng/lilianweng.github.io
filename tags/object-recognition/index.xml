      <description>[Updated on 2020-01-09: add a new section on Contrastive Predictive Coding]. [Updated on 2020-04-13: add a &amp;ldquo;Momentum Contrast&amp;rdquo; section on MoCo, SimCLR and CURL.] [Updated on 2020-07-08: add a &amp;ldquo;Bisimulation&amp;rdquo; section on DeepMDP and DBC.] [Updated on 2020-09-12: add MoCo V2 and BYOL in the &amp;ldquo;Momentum Contrast&amp;rdquo; section.] [Updated on 2021-05-31: remove section on &amp;ldquo;Momentum Contrast&amp;rdquo; and add a pointer to a full post on &amp;ldquo;Contrastive Representation Learning&amp;rdquo;]
Given a task and enough labels, supervised learning can solve it really well.</description>

      <title>Object Detection Part 4: Fast Detection Models</title>

      <description>In Part 3, we have reviewed models in the R-CNN family. All of them are region-based object detection algorithms. They can achieve high accuracy but could be too slow for certain applications such as autonomous driving. In Part 4, we only focus on fast object detection models, including SSD, RetinaNet, and models in the YOLO family.

      <description>[Updated on 2018-12-20: Remove YOLO here. Part 4 will cover multiple fast object detection algorithms, including YOLO.] [Updated on 2018-12-27: Add bbox regression and tricks sections for R-CNN.]
In the series of &amp;ldquo;Object Detection for Dummies&amp;rdquo;, we started with basic concepts in image processing, such as gradient vectors and HOG, in Part 1. Then we introduced classic convolutional neural network architecture designs for classification and pioneer models for object recognition, Overfeat and DPM, in Part 2.</description>

      <description>Part 1 of the &amp;ldquo;Object Detection for Dummies&amp;rdquo; series introduced: (1) the concept of image gradient vector and how HOG algorithm summarizes the information across all the gradient vectors in one image; (2) how the image segmentation algorithm works to detect regions that potentially contain objects; (3) how the Selective Search algorithm refines the outcomes of image segmentation for better region proposal.
In Part 2, we are about to find out more on the classic convolution neural network architectures for image classification.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never worked in the field of computer vision and has no idea how the magic could work when an autonomous car is configured to tell apart a stop sign from a pedestrian in a red hat. To motivate myself to look into the maths behind object recognition and detection algorithms, I&amp;rsquo;m writing a few posts on this topic &amp;ldquo;Object Detection for Dummies&amp;rdquo;. This post, part 1, starts with super rudimentary concepts in image processing and a few methods for image segmentation.</description>
