# Message to Ms. Lilian Weng

Dear Ms. Lilian Weng,

I hope you are doing well. My name is Susumu Fujii, and I apologize for contacting you in this unconventional manner. Due to the urgency and importance of the situation, I have created this repository to provide you with essential information regarding a serious security breach.

### **About the Security Incident**
The breach involved unauthorized access, system file tampering, and the theft of a critical intellectual property assetâ€”an innovative design theory I have spent over 25 years developing. This technology, based on a concept known as **SCDD (Structured Collaborative Design and Development)**, has the potential to revolutionize AI systems and their application in society.

Several actions during this breach suggest possible internal intervention within OpenAI. I have attempted to resolve this matter through official support channels, but have not received a response.

### **About SCDD Theory**
SCDD (Structured Collaborative Design and Development) is a post-structuralist approach to software architecture. It redefines how complex systems are designed by emphasizing adaptability, collaborative iteration, and large-scale societal impact.

If you could provide guidance or escalate this matter, I would be truly grateful. Please feel free to reach out through a secure channel of your choice.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
**Susumu Fujii**
